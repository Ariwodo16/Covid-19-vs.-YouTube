## Project Description/Outline: 

Our goal is to analyze a variety of trends of YouTube viewership during the height of the second U.S. COVID wave. We plan to use a dataset acquired from kaggle.com and the Google API for YouTube usage to determine a number of key factors around channel popularity, popular search trends by month, and total accounts created in the time period. 

The time period we are focusing our research on is data that ranges from 08/2020 through 08/2021 for a COVID time frame, as well as data from 09/2021-07/2022 for Post-COVID.

## Research Questions to Answer:

1) Most popular trending videos- based on likes, view counts, and unique days the video trended
    - What drives a video’s popularity? Likes or dislikes
    - Based on our dataset, what is the probability of these videos gaining popularity
        - Correlation of view counts and likes
        - Correlation of view counts and dislikes
        - Using outliers and boxplots 
        
2) Popularity of video categories during covid
    - In the time period defined, which three video categories had the highest volume of videos posted?
        - For each category, what was the average view count per video?
        - Can we determine a correlation of like count to volume of views?
        
3) Video category analysis:
     - Which three video categories had the highest volume of videos posted? 
     - Did seasonality potentially drive content creators to post more? Out of the three categories with the highest volume of videos posted, which month did each category have the highest amount of videos posted?
          - Can we surmise any anecdotal conclusions based on the findings?
